Here is an effort to make a music app through my skills and existing options !!!

### **Music Player Requirement Analysis**

#### **1. Functional Requirements**
- **Core Playback:**
  - **File Support:** Play MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, and other common formats.
  - **Playback Controls:** Play, pause, skip (next/previous), shuffle, repeat, volume adjustment, and seek bar.
  - **Playback Modes:** Loop (single track/playlist), shuffle, crossfade, and sleep timer.

- **Library Management:**
  - **Metadata Handling:** Auto-fetch/edit track details (title, artist, album, genre, artwork).
  - **Organize Music:** Sort by title, artist, album, date added, or custom tags.
  - **Playlist Creation:** Create, edit, delete, import/export playlists (e.g., M3U, PLS formats).

- **User Interface (UI):**
  - **Now Playing Screen:** Display artwork, lyrics, progress bar, and playback controls.
  - **Search:** Quick search by title, artist, or album.
  - **Themes:** Light/dark mode, customizable color schemes.
  - **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support, adjustable font sizes.

- **Advanced Features:**
  - **Equalizer:** Presets and manual adjustments (bass, treble, etc.).
  - **Lyrics Integration:** Auto-fetch and display synchronized lyrics.
  - **Notifications:** Track info in system notifications/status bar.
  - **Cloud Sync:** Backup libraries/playlists to services like Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **User Accounts:**
  - **Authentication:** Sign-up/login via email, social media, or SSO.
  - **Preferences Sync:** Sync settings (playlists, themes) across devices.

#### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance:**
  - Load tracks within 1–2 seconds; handle 10,000+ songs without lag.
  - Use ≤20% CPU during playback on average hardware.

- **Compatibility:**
  - **OS Support:** Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux.
  - **Hardware:** Minimum 2GB RAM, 100MB storage for installation.

- **Security:**
  - Encrypt user credentials and sensitive data (e.g., payment info for premium features).
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance for data privacy.

- **Usability:**
  - Intuitive UI/UX with onboarding tutorials.
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop screens.

- **Reliability:**
  - Handle corrupted files gracefully (skip/log errors without crashing).
  - 99% uptime for cloud-dependent features.

#### **3. User Roles**
- **End User:** Access playback, library, playlists, and settings.
- **Admin:** Manage user accounts, app updates, and content moderation.
- **Guest:** Limited access (e.g., trial mode with ads).

#### **4. External Requirements**
- **Integrations:**
  - Streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music) via APIs.
  - Social media sharing (Twitter, Instagram) for track sharing.
  - Hardware integrations (Bluetooth devices, Chromecast).

- **Legal:**
  - Codec licensing (e.g., MP3 patents).
  - Clear terms of service and privacy policy.

#### **5. System Requirements**
- **Mobile:** Android 8+/iOS 13+, 4GB RAM recommended.
- **Desktop:** Windows 10+, macOS Catalina+, 8GB RAM for large libraries.
- **Storage:** 500MB+ for app + space for music files.

#### **6. Constraints**
- Budget limits on third-party API usage (e.g., Spotify integration costs).
- Time constraints for Phase 1 (core features) vs. Phase 2 (cloud sync, social sharing).

#### **7. Assumptions**
- Users have basic tech literacy.
- Primary use case: Personal music libraries (not enterprise).
- Internet optional except for cloud/streaming features.

#### **8. Risks**
- **Third-Party Dependencies:** Codec licensing costs or API changes.
- **Performance:** Slow library scans on low-end devices.

#### **9. Prioritization**
- **High:** Core playback, library management, basic UI.
- **Medium:** Equalizer, cloud sync, themes.
- **Low:** Social sharing, admin dashboard.
